<h1 align="center">ðŸ“Š University Rankings Analysis</h1>

<h3>ðŸ“– Project Overview</h3>
<p>
    This project involves web scraping and analyzing university ranking data from the 
    <a href="https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?tabletype=full-table" target="_blank">Complete University Guide</a>. 
    Using R and the <code>rvest</code> library, our group extracted key indicators to address five analytical problem statements, providing insights into 
    the relationships between university spending, student satisfaction, entry standards, and graduation prospects.
