<h1 align="center">ðŸ“Š University Rankings Analysis</h1>

<h3>ðŸ“– Project Overview</h3>
<p>
    This project involves web scraping and analyzing university ranking data from the 
    <a href="https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?tabletype=full-table" target="_blank">Complete University Guide</a>. 
    Using R and the <code>rvest</code> library, we extracted key indicators to address five analytical problem statements, providing insights into 
    the relationships between university spending, student satisfaction, entry standards, and graduation prospects.

    <li><strong>Problem Statements & Findings:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Which universities spend the most on resources?</strong>  
                Universities like Harper Adams and Cambridge prioritize resources, with varying emphasis on facilities vs. academic services. High spending doesnâ€™t always correlate with top rankings.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Does high academic spending result in high student satisfaction?</strong>  
                Thereâ€™s no clear relationship between academic spending and student satisfaction; other factors like teaching quality or graduate outcomes may play a bigger role.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Is there a relationship between overall score and entry standards?</strong>  
                A strong positive correlation exists; universities with higher overall scores tend to have stricter entry standards.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Do graduate prospects on track translate to graduate prospects outcomes?</strong>  
                A strong positive relationship was found; higher on-track prospects often lead to better graduate outcomes, though these donâ€™t heavily influence university rankings.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Does a university with high entry standards lead to better degree completion rates?</strong>  
                A moderate positive correlation exists; higher entry standards are associated with increased degree completion rates, but other factors also contribute.
